   <p>July 7th, 17—.</p>
   <p>
      <hi rend="smallcaps">MY DEAR SISTER</hi>,</p>
   <p>I <hi rend="smallcaps">WRITE</hi> a few lines in haste, to say that I am safe, and well
          advanced on my voyage. This letter will reach England by a merchant-man now on its
          homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not see my native land,
          perhaps, for many years. I am, however, in good spirits: my <del>men</del><add>crew</add> are <del>bold</del><add>gallant fellows</add>, <del>and apparently</del><add>&amp; I am</add>
          firm of purpose; nor do the floating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indi<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_031" n="019"/>cating the dangers of the region towards which we are
          advancing, appear to dismay them. We have already reached a very high latitude; but it is
          the height of summer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales, which
          blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire to attain, breathe a
          degree of renovating warmth which I had not expected. <add place="margin">The appearance of the sky is indiscribably beautiful; clear by day, and illuminated at night by the Aurora Borealis <del rend="strikethrough">w</del> which spreads a roseate tinge over the heavens, &amp; over the sea which reflects it’s splendour.</add></p>
   <p>No incidents have hitherto befallen us, that would make a figure in a letter. One or two
          <del>stiff</del><add>hard</add> gales, and the <del>breaking</del><add>carrying away</add> of a mast, are accidents which experienced navigators
          scarcely remember to record; and I shall be well content, if nothing worse happen to us
          during our voyage.</p>
   <p>Adieu, my dear Margaret. Be assured, that for my own sake, as well as your’s, I will not
          rashly encounter dan<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_032" n="020"/>ger. I will be cool,
          persevering, and prudent.</p>
   <p>Remember me to all my English friends.</p>
   <p>Most affectionately yours,</p>
   <p>R.W.</p>
